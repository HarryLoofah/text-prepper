text-prepper
============

Manipulates text proficient examples for use in ELA instruction. Teacher
inputs exemplar for end of week or end of unit application, and TextPrepper
returns text with highlighted parts of speech, possible sentence frames
depending on the week or the unit's focus language, and other information
that will help the teacher during lesson planning.

##To Use:

1.Write a proficient example which includes focus language and functions.
2. Copy and paste text into TextPrepper window.
3. Hit "run" and TextPrepper highlights the main parts of speech found
in the text. This allows teacher to add more of the focus language if
the find that they haven't included enough, or to use individual sentences
from the exemplar to build sentence frames for use in class.
4. The TextPrepper web app uses dropdowns to allow the teacher to narrow
the range of targeted language for highlighting.
